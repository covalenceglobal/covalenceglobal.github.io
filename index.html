		<h1><mark>Welcome</mark></h1>
		<p>Covalence Global is an organization founded and run <b>100% by youth</b>. With a strong emphasis on <b>action</b>, we organize projects, events, and journal articles connected to climate change. </p>
		<br>
		<h1><mark>Our Purpose</mark></h1>
		<p>Covalence's purpose is to foster <b>"covalent bonds"</b> by building a global community of youth leaders combating climate change. We work to create a <b>dynamic workspace</b> for youth to take action on the world's most prevalent environmental issues.</p>
		<br>
		<h1><mark>We Empower</mark></h1>
		<p><b>Honesty</b>, <b>respect</b>, and <b>responsibility</b> are the core foundations of Covalence. We build each other up - not bring each other down. <b>We seek to empower</b>; we work to promote each others' platforms. If our core values - honesty, respect, and responsibility - are ever violated, <b>we take effective measures to address the issue at hand.</b></p>
		<br>
		<h1><mark>Our Youth Network</mark></h1>
		<p>We manage a platform that empowers youth who care about climate action to <b>connect</b> and <b>collaborate</b> with like-minded individuals. We provide members with the opportunity to <b>initiate</b> their own <b>projects</b>, <b>events</b>, and <b>journal articles</b>. We also facilitate collaboration, <b>building bonds</b> between youths who would complement each others' work. Furthermore, we host <b>bi-monthly meetings</b>, organizing networking mixers, inviting guest speakers, and spotlighting members' work. Our productive networking system and dynamic action hub advances the work of the earth's future leaders. Currently, our network spans <b>5 continents</b>, with <b>over 45% of members holding Bachelor Degrees.</b></p>
		<h1><mark>Learn, Share, Build</mark></h1>
		<section class="lsb">
			<p>We believe this three-step process is vital to taking effective action:</p>
			<br>
			<h2><mark>Learn</mark></h2>
			<p>We challenge ourselves to develop a deeper understanding of climate issues and consider multiple perspectives.</p>
			<h2><mark>Share</mark></h2>
			<p>We encourage respectful debate and discussion.</p>
			<h2><mark>Build</mark></h2>
			<p>We strongly emphasize the importance of building on what we learn and share about. We believe that learning and sharing are crucial, but building is the ingredient to working towards action.</p>
		</section>
		<br>
		<h1><mark>Action Is Our Goal</mark></h1>
		<p>Taking action is the ultimate goal we strive to reach. As mentioned above, learning, sharing, and building are crucial to fueling this process. Every time we have a youth network Zoom meeting or host an event, we close by considering, <i>How can we utilize what we just learned and shared about to take action?</i> We are doers.</p>
		<br>
		<h1><mark>Our History</mark></h1>
		<p>Previously, Covalence was a locally focused organization. We worked to purify the Bay Area's waters through weekly beach cleanups. We ended up picking up around 500 pounds of trash. However, we now seek a global vision that reaches multiple communities and tackles bigger problems. This is how Covalence Global was born.</p>
