	<h2>About Covalence - SF</h2>
		<p>Previously, Covalence was a locally focused organization. We worked to purify the Bay Area's waters through weekly beach cleanups. However, our focal point has shifted to a global mission. This is how Covalence - Global was born!</p>
	<h2>About Covalence - Global</h2>
			<p>Covalence's purpose is to foster "covalent bonds" by building a community of fellow environmentalists that strive to make a positive difference in climate change. Our mission is to <b>inform</b> people about climate change, <b>inspire</b> them to take action, and ultimately <b>lead</b> a global movement. </p>
	<h2>Our Logo</h2>
		<p>Firstly, we added the earth, our home, to emphasize what we are fighting for. We then included a group of "covalent" people wrapped around the planet, protecting it from the dangers of an increase in greenhouse gas emissions; we wanted to demonstrate how we are working to build an international network of unique and authentic people.</p>
