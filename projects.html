	<h2>Covalence - SF</h2>
	<img id="beachCleanup" src ="beachCleanup.jpg">
	<p id="recentProject">Our most recent project was a locally-focused beach cleanup group. We worked to care for the Bay Area's waters, picking up over 500 pounds of trash. We also provided members with other SF community service opportunities, such as tree planting, food banks, and garden preservation. </p>
