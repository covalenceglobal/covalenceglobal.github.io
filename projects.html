	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>All of our projects are climate-related. They strive to make a positive impact on topics including science/innovation, climate change breakthroughs, environmental awareness, environmental policy, new economic paradigms, etc. If you are interested in partnering with us on a project, please fill out <a id="partnerForm" href ="https://forms.gle/kPWo5sHAZXBZotSbA">this form.</a></p>
	<h2>Covalent Youth</h2>
	<p>Covalent Youth promotes Covalence's mission by providing a platform that enables youth who care about climate change to connect with other like-minded individuals. CGY creates a productive networking system for the earth's future environmental leaders.

	<p>Members of our youth network are invited to:
	join any of our events, present/feature their work in our events, serve as mentors to rising climate change leaders, write for our journal, present/feature their work on our websites, present/feature their work on our other media platforms, engage in dynamic discussion and collaboration with other Covalent youth, contribute their skills to our projects and event planning, etc.</p>

	<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
	<p><i>What kind of role would I be taking on?</i></p>
	<p>This is completely up to you! We will be sending weekly newsletters with several opportunities/updates, ranging from our journal posts to upcoming projects/events (see below for examples). If you are ever interested in any of the activities, you can respond to the email, and you will be able to work with us/the other youth who are also interested. You set your commitment level. The only required events would be attending our bi-monthly youth network Zoom meetings, but we encourage more involvement if your time permits!</p>

	<p><i>What kind of work would I be doing?</i></p>
	<p>Obviously, we want your main priority to be connecting with other youth leaders! (Here is a <a id="software" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUWEHGOedG7VKushNqAhhajLXg5x6TQ6rVCsZR7cM3U/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to how our software plan works.) However, as stated above, the weekly newsletters will pose several opportunities. If you are interested in researching/reporting, you can write articles for our journal. If you would like to help plan an event, you can coordinate times/dates, reach out to people who might be interested, and plan the agenda. If you would like to join a project (such as organizing a chapter, climate lobbying, coordinating an initiative, creating an environment-promoting software), we will make sure that you can contribute your skills. Finally, if you would like to initiate your own project, we would love to support you. One of the great things about starting your own project is that we can reach out to the youth network and pair you with individuals who would contribute great skills to your work!</p>

	<h2>Covalence - SF</h2>
	<img id="beachCleanup" src ="beachCleanup.jpg">
	<p id="recentProject">Our most recent project was a locally-focused beach cleanup group. We worked to care for the Bay Area's waters, picking up over 500 pounds of trash. We also provided members with other SF community service opportunities, such as tree planting, food banks, and garden preservation. </p>
