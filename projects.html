	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>All of our projects are climate-related. They strive to make a positive impact on topics including science/innovation, climate change breakthroughs, environmental awareness, environmental policy, new economic paradigms, etc. If you are interested in partnering with us on a project, please fill out <a id="partnerForm" href ="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS2P3dvxB85ctPYAJqYYfv1eJtRzAvs2ZdjsSRdncTpf7bOQ/viewform">this form.</a></p>
	<h2>Covalent Youth</h2>
	<p>Covalent Youth promotes Covalence's mission by providing a platform that enables youth who care about climate change and justice to connect with other like-minded individuals. CGY creates a productive networking system for the earth's future environmental leaders. Our youth network spans <b>5 continents</b> and several <b>US states</b>.</p>

	<p><b>How It Works</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Main priority:</b> connecting with other youth using our software platform. Here is a <a id="software" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUWEHGOedG7VKushNqAhhajLXg5x6TQ6rVCsZR7cM3U/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to how our software works.</li>
			<li><b>Minimum commitment:</b> attend bi-monthly (meaning once every two months) Zoom meetings with fellow youth. However, we encourage participation in our projects, events, or journal if your time permits!</li>
			<li><b>Our bi-monthly Zoom meetings will include:</b> networking, intellectual discussion, guest speakers, project/event planning, etc.</li>
			<li><b>Youth opportunities:</b> We will be sending weekly newsletters. These newsletters will include a review of our projects, events, and journal posts, as well as potential projects/events/journal posts that youth are invited to help with.</li>
					<li id="indent"><b>Projects:</b> Youth may either join a current project or initiate their own project. Projects can be anything from a week long to year long & beyond! Projects may range from climate lobbying, to coding an eco-friendly software platform, to starting a local community service chapter. If you are interested in contributing to a project, we will connect you and make sure that your skills are put to good use. If you are interested in initiating a project, we will support you. One of the great things about starting your own project is that we can reach out to the youth network and pair you with individuals who would contribute great skills to your work!</li>
					<li id="indent"><b>Events:</b> Youth may initiate their own events. These events can be anything from an hour long to a day long! Events may range from expert panels to leadership workshops. If you are interested in contributing to an event, we will connect you and make sure that your skills are put to good use. If you are interested in initiating an event, we will support you. One of the great things about starting your own event is that we can reach out to the youth network and pair you with individuals who would contribute great skills to your work!</li>
					<li id="indent">J<b>ournal:</b> Youth may write for our journal. This can be anything from posting articles consistently to writing a single op-ed. Topics can range from the technology of nuclear fission to climate justice. We would love to elevate your ideas!</li>
			<li><b>Social media/website:</b> We would love to feature any of your work on our website and growing media platforms.</li>

	<h2>Covalence - SF</h2>
	<img id="beachCleanup" src ="beachCleanup.jpg">
	<p id="recentProject">Our most recent project was a locally-focused beach cleanup group. We worked to care for the Bay Area's waters, picking up over 500 pounds of trash. We also provided members with other SF community service opportunities, such as tree planting, food banks, and garden preservation. </p>
